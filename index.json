However, recent supply-chain attacks demonstrate that application integrity must be ensured during installation itself. We introduce SIGL, a new tool for detecting malicious behavior during software installation. SIGL collects traces of system call activity, building a data provenance graph that it analyzes using a novel autoencoder architecture with a graph long short-term memory network (graph LSTM) for the encoder and a standard multilayer perceptron for the decoder. SIGL flags suspicious installations as well as the specific installation-time processes that are likely to be malicious. Using a test corpus of 625 malicious installers containing real-world malware, we demonstrate that SIGL has a detection accuracy of 96%, outperforming similar systems from industry and academia by up to 87% in precision and recall and 45% in accuracy. We also demonstrate that SIGL can pinpoint the processes most likely to have triggered malicious behavior, works on different audit platforms and operating systems, and is robust to training data contamination and adversarial attack. It can be used with application-specific models, even in the presence of new software versions, as well as application-agnostic meta-models that encompass a wide range of applications and installers.","tags":null,"title":"SIGL: Securing Software Installations Through Deep Graph Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606388400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606392667,"objectID":"212519dd244866cde1769d8376affab0","permalink":"https://tfjmp.org/talk/2020-toshiba/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-toshiba/","section":"talk","summary":"Provenance is the representation of a system execution as a directed acyclic graph.

The existing approaches for configuration tuning are expensive and overlook the dynamic characteristics of the analytics environment (i.e. frequent changes in workload due to receiving evolving input sizes or change in the underlying cluster environment). Such workload/environment changes can cause significant performance degradation, with retuning the configuration to accommodate those changes can yield up to 85% potential execution time saving. We propose SimTune, an approach that accommodates such changes through efficient configuration tuning. SimTune combines workload characterization and Multitask Bayesian optimization to identify similarity across workloads and accelerate finding near-optimal configurations. Our experimental results show that SimTune reduces the search time for finding close to optimal configurations by 56-73% (at the median) when compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. This means that the amortization of the tuning cost happens significantly faster, enabling practical tuning in the rapidly changing environment of distributed analytics.","tags":null,"title":"Accelerating the Configuration Tuning of Big Data Analytics with Similarity-aware Multitask Bayesian Optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600646400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606249399,"objectID":"788bb557c05eaedfbbe65c592e9a28cb","permalink":"https://tfjmp.org/project/synergia/","publishdate":"2020-09-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/synergia/","section":"project","summary":"Secure by design end to end platform for large scale resource constrained IoT applications.","tags":["IoT","security"],"title":"SYNERGIA","type":"project"},{"authors":["A Fekry","L Carata","T Pasquier","A Rice","A Hopper"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606572817,"objectID":"06c6ba75cf5961bcc7462a9211b6a9e7","permalink":"https://tfjmp.org/publication/2020-kdd/","publishdate":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-kdd/","section":"publication","summary":"This experimental study presents a number of issues that pose a challenge for practical configuration tuning and its deployment in data analytics frameworks.

Unfortunately, evaluating these anomaly detectors is hard. There are few high-quality, publiclyavailable audit logs, and there are no pre-existing frameworks that enable push-button creation of realistic system traces. To make trace generation easier, we created Xanthus, an automated tool that orchestrates virtual machines to generate realistic audit logs. Using Xanthus’ simple management interface, administrators select a base VM image, configure a particular tracing framework to use within that VM, and define post-launch scripts that collect and save trace data. Once data collection is finished, Xanthus creates a self-describing archive, which contains the VM, its configuration parameters, and the collected trace data. We demonstrate that Xanthus hides many of the tedious (yet subtle) orchestration tasks that humans often get wrong; Xanthus avoids mistakes that lead to non-replicable experiments","tags":null,"title":"Xanthus: Push-button Orchestration of Host Provenance Data Collection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["X Han","T Pasquier","A Bates","J Mickens","M Seltzer"],"categories":null,"content":"  ","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606572817,"objectID":"761626ce975ec661e9ac468b242fb563","permalink":"https://tfjmp.org/publication/2020-ndss/","publishdate":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-ndss/","section":"publication","summary":"Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are difficult to detect due to their low-and-slow attack patterns and frequent use of zero-day exploits.

The situation gets even more complex when multiple LEAs across different jurisdictions are involved, e.g., because of the distributed locations of cloud servers and data storage. Yet cloud providers typically do not need or want to know about their tenants' activities, other than measuring how such activities incur expenses for using cloud resources. Thus mechanisms should be developed for cloud providers to have sufficient plausible deniability with regards to the processing being carried out by tenants on their platform, in jurisdictions that permit cloud providers to avoid liabilities in this way. Symmetrically, such mechanisms could protect tenants from legal over-reach, for example, when the country in which the cloud provider is incorporated could force disclosure of the processing carried out by cloud tenants. But to what extent can cloud providers acquire plausible deniability? Current discussions regarding risk have focused on data confidentiality and integrity. We argue that processing operations can equally reveal sensitive information---such as trade secrets and business processes---and that for some classes of application both data protection and algorithm protection are necessary. In this paper, we examine the legal and technical motivations for achieving plausible deniability in cloud interactions. We demonstrate the likely performance overhead of using containers secured with technologies such as Intel SGX. Further, we examine the current limitations of our proposed plausible deniability mechanisms, and outline a potential approach for enabling lawful access to enclaves subject to appropriate judicial oversight.","tags":null,"title":"Facilitating plausible deniability for cloud providers regarding tenants' activities using trusted execution","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579100400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606310770,"objectID":"b1fd020989306f06fb92b0bf19e77daa","permalink":"https://tfjmp.org/talk/2020-winter/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-winter/","section":"talk","summary":"Whole-system provenance is the record of flows of information between kernel objects (e.g., files, task, sockets etc.).

Digital provenance provides a detailed history of the flow of information within a computing system, connecting suspicious events to their root causes. Although existing provenance-based auditing techniques provide value in forensic analysis, they assume that such analysis takes place only retrospectively.

The audit of policy enforcement must assist the apportionment of liability, demonstrate compliance with regulation, and indicate whether policy correctly captures legal responsibilities. As both systems and obligations evolve dynamically, this cycle must be continuously maintained. This poses a huge challenge given the global scale of the IoT vision. The IoT entails dynamically creating new services through managed and flexible data exchange. Data management is complex in this dynamic environment, given the need to both control and share information, often across federated domains of administration. We see middleware playing a key role in managing the IoT. Our vision is for a middleware-enforced, unified policy model that applies end-to-end, throughout the IoT. This is because policy cannot be bound to things, applications, or administrative domains, since functionality is the result of composition, with dynamically formed chains of data flows. We have investigated the use of Information Flow Control (IFC) to manage and audit data flows in cloud computing; a domain where trust can be well-founded, regulations are more mature and associated responsibilities clearer.

From the start, strong isolation between cloud tenants was seen to be of paramount importance, provided first by virtual machines (VM) and later by containers, which share the operating system (OS) kernel. Increasingly it is the case that applications also require facilities to effect isolation and protection of data managed by those applications. They also require flexible data sharing with other applications, often across the traditional cloud-isolation boundaries; for example, when government, consisting of different departments, provides services to its citizens through a common platform. These concerns relate to the management of data. Traditional access control is application and principal/role specific, applied at policy enforcement points, after which there is no subsequent control over where data flows;a crucial issue once data has left its owner’s control by cloud-hosted applications andwithin cloud-services. Information Flow Control (IFC), in addition, offers system-wide, end-to-end, flow control based on the properties of the data. We discuss the potential of cloud-deployed IFC for enforcing owners’ data flow policy with regard to protection and sharing, aswell as safeguarding against malicious or buggy software. In addition, the audit log associated with IFC provides transparency and offers system-wide visibility over data flows. This helps those responsible to meet their data management obligations, providing evidence of compliance, and aids in the identification ofpolicy errors and misconfigurations. We present our IFC model and describe and evaluate our IFC architecture and implementation (CamFlow). This comprises an OS level implementation of IFC with support for application management, together with an IFC-enabled middleware.","tags":null,"title":"CamFlow: Managed Data-Sharing for Cloud Services","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Singh","J Powles","T Pasquier","J Bacon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1442361600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606572817,"objectID":"4ddf116a9954afc7354363714c8944bc","permalink":"https://tfjmp.org/publication/2015-ccm/","publishdate":"2015-09-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-ccm/","section":"publication","summary":"As cloud computing becomes an increasingly dominant means of providing computing resources, the legal and regulatory issues associated with data in the cloud become more pronounced. These issues derive primarily from four areas: contract, data protection, law enforcement, and regulatory and common law protections for particularly sensitive domains such as health, finance, fiduciary relations, and intellectual property assets. From a technical perspective, these legal requirements all impose information management obligations on data sharing and transmission within cloud-hosted applications and services. They might restrict how, when, where, and by whom data may flow and be accessed.

To address this, cloud tenants/applications are traditionally isolated in virtual machines or containers. But an emerging requirement is for cross-application sharing of data, for example, when cloud services form part of an IoT architecture. Information Flow Control (IFC) is ideally suited to achieving both isolation and data sharing as required. IFC enhances traditional Access Control by providing continuous, data-centric, cross-application, end-to-end control of data flows. However, large-scale data processing is a major requirement of cloud computing and is infeasible under standard IFC. We present a novel, enhanced IFC model that subsumes standard models. Our IFC model supports Big Data processing, while retaining the simplicity of standard IFC and enabling more concise, accurate and maintainable expression of policy.","tags":null,"title":"Managing Big Data with Information Flow Control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Singh","T Pasquier","J Bacon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1428364800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606572817,"objectID":"a47622cedad99c177dcfc6fa92f3185b","permalink":"https://tfjmp.org/publication/2015-riot/","publishdate":"2015-04-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-riot/","section":"publication","summary":"To realise the full potential of the Internet of Things (loT), loT architectures are moving towards open and dynamic interoperability, as opposed to closed application silos. This is because functionality is realised through the interactions, i.e. the exchange of data, between a wide-range of 'things'. Data sharing requires management. Towards this, we are exploring distributed, decentralised Information Flow Control (IFC) to enable controlled data flows, end-to-end, according to policy. In this paper we make the case for IFC, as a data-centric control mechanism, for securing loT architectures. Previous research on IFC focuses on a particular system or application, e.g. within an operating system, with little concern for wide-scale, dynamic systems. To render IFC applicable to loT, we present a certificate-based model for secure, trustworthy policy specification, that also reflects real-world loT concerns such as 'thing' ownership. This approach enables decentralised, distributed, verifiable policy specification, crucial for securing the wide-ranging, dynamic interactions of future loT applications.","tags":null,"title":"Securing Tags to Control Information Flows within the Internet of Things","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T Pasquier","J Singh","J Bacon","D Eyers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1425859200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606572817,"objectID":"11c512c5c5d535acdb750173ed45103c","permalink":"https://tfjmp.org/publication/2015-ic2e/","publishdate":"2015-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-ic2e/","section":"publication","summary":"Security is an ongoing challenge in cloud computing.

Our aim was to support the use of an unmodified Platform as a Service (PaaS) cloud infrastructure by IFC-aware web applications.

Although use of AOP has been mentioned as a possibility in past IFC literature we believe this paper to be the first illustration of how such an implementation can be attempted. We discuss how we built FlowR (Information Flow Control for Ruby), a library extending Ruby to provide IFC primitives using AOP via the Aquarium open source library. Previous attempts at providing IFC as a language extension required either modification of an interpreter or significant code rewriting. FlowR provides a strong separation between functional implementation and security constraints which supports easier development and maintenance; we illustrate with practical examples. In addition, we provide new primitives to describe IFC constraints on objects, classes and methods that, to our knowledge, are not present in related work and take full advantage of an object oriented language (OO language).

As a result, there is potential for decentralised IFC to achieve better cloud security than is available today. In this paper we describe the properties of cloud computing-Platform-as-a-Service clouds in particular-and review a range of IFC models and implementations to identify opportunities for using IFC within a cloud computing context.
