State-of-the-art reference-monitor-based audit techniques greatly improve the quality of audit logs, but their system-wide architecture is too costly to be adapted for individual containers. Moreover, these techniques typically require extensive kernel modifications, making it difficult to deploy in practical settings. In this paper, we present saBPF (**s**ecure **a**udit **BPF**), an extension of the eBPF framework capable of deploying secure system-level audit mechanisms at the container granularity. We demonstrate the practicality of saBPF in Kubernetes by designing an audit framework, an intrusion detection system, and a lightweight access control mechanism. We evaluate saBPF and show that it is comparable in performance and security guarantees to audit systems from the literature that are implemented directly in the kernel.","tags":null,"title":"Secure Namespaced Kernel Audit for Containers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["X Han","X Yu","T Pasquier","D Li","J Rhee","J Mickens","M Seltzer","C Haifeng"],"categories":null,"content":"  ","date":1628640000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631334644,"objectID":"4d8ba397de00266c5ab0d0d39e2de526","permalink":"https://tfjmp.org/publication/2021-usenixsec/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-usenixsec/","section":"publication","summary":"Many users implicitly assume that software can only be exploited after it is installed.

SIGL flags suspicious installations as well as the specific installation-time processes that are likely to be malicious. Using a test corpus of 625 malicious installers containing real-world malware, we demonstrate that SIGL has a detection accuracy of 96%, outperforming similar systems from industry and academia by up to 87% in precision and recall and 45% in accuracy. We also demonstrate that SIGL can pinpoint the processes most likely to have triggered malicious behavior, works on different audit platforms and operating systems, and is robust to training data contamination and adversarial attack.

The existing approaches for configuration tuning are expensive and overlook the dynamic characteristics of the analytics environment (i.e. frequent changes in workload due to receiving evolving input sizes or change in the underlying cluster environment). Such workload/environment changes can cause significant performance degradation, with retuning the configuration to accommodate those changes can yield up to 85% potential execution time saving. We propose SimTune, an approach that accommodates such changes through efficient configuration tuning. SimTune combines workload characterization and Multitask Bayesian optimization to identify similarity across workloads and accelerate finding near-optimal configurations. Our experimental results show that SimTune reduces the search time for finding close to optimal configurations by 56-73% (at the median) when compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. This means that the amortization of the tuning cost happens significantly faster, enabling practical tuning in the rapidly changing environment of distributed analytics.","tags":null,"title":"Accelerating the Configuration Tuning of Big Data Analytics with Similarity-aware Multitask Bayesian Optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600646400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612786309,"objectID":"788bb557c05eaedfbbe65c592e9a28cb","permalink":"https://tfjmp.org/project/synergia/","publishdate":"2020-09-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/synergia/","section":"project","summary":"Secure by design end to end platform for large scale resource constrained IoT applications.","tags":["IoT","security"],"title":"SYNERGIA","type":"project"},{"authors":["A Fekry","L Carata","T Pasquier","A Rice","A Hopper"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635291469,"objectID":"06c6ba75cf5961bcc7462a9211b6a9e7","permalink":"https://tfjmp.org/publication/2020-kdd/","publishdate":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-kdd/","section":"publication","summary":"This experimental study presents a number of issues that pose a challenge for practical configuration tuning and its deployment in data analytics frameworks.

The situation gets even more complex when multiple LEAs across different jurisdictions are involved, e.g., because of the distributed locations of cloud servers and data storage. Yet cloud providers typically do not need or want to know about their tenants' activities, other than measuring how such activities incur expenses for using cloud resources. Thus mechanisms should be developed for cloud providers to have sufficient plausible deniability with regards to the processing being carried out by tenants on their platform, in jurisdictions that permit cloud providers to avoid liabilities in this way. Symmetrically, such mechanisms could protect tenants from legal over-reach, for example, when the country in which the cloud provider is incorporated could force disclosure of the processing carried out by cloud tenants. But to what extent can cloud providers acquire plausible deniability? Current discussions regarding risk have focused on data confidentiality and integrity. We argue that processing operations can equally reveal sensitive information---such as trade secrets and business processes---and that for some classes of application both data protection and algorithm protection are necessary. In this paper, we examine the legal and technical motivations for achieving plausible deniability in cloud interactions. We demonstrate the likely performance overhead of using containers secured with technologies such as Intel SGX. Further, we examine the current limitations of our proposed plausible deniability mechanisms, and outline a potential approach for enabling lawful access to enclaves subject to appropriate judicial oversight.","tags":null,"title":"Facilitating plausible deniability for cloud providers regarding tenants' activities using trusted execution","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579100400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579100400,"objectID":"1cdfc4445a5565f8169418eb4f044866","permalink":"https://tfjmp.org/talk/provenance-based-intrusion-detection/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/provenance-based-intrusion-detection/","section":"event","summary":"Whole-system provenance is the record of flows of information between kernel objects (e.g., files, task, sockets etc.).

They have both the vantage point to collect actionable information, economies of scale and position to adjust parameters when dynamic conditions change, in order to fulfil SLOs that go beyond classic measures of latency and throughput. This is at odds with the existing approach of making software (including the interfaces to the cloud and the processing frameworks) as configurable as possible.

We argue that for the IoT to develop lawfully, there must be technical mechanisms that allow the enforcement of specified policy, such that systems align with legal realities. The audit of policy enforcement must assist the apportionment of liability, demonstrate compliance with regulation, and indicate whether policy correctly captures legal responsibilities. As both systems and obligations evolve dynamically, this cycle must be continuously maintained. This poses a huge challenge given the global scale of the IoT vision. The IoT entails dynamically creating new services through managed and flexible data exchange. Data management is complex in this dynamic environment, given the need to both control and share information, often across federated domains of administration. We see middleware playing a key role in managing the IoT. Our vision is for a middleware-enforced, unified policy model that applies end-to-end, throughout the IoT. This is because policy cannot be bound to things, applications, or administrative domains, since functionality is the result of composition, with dynamically formed chains of data flows. We have investigated the use of Information Flow Control (IFC) to manage and audit data flows in cloud computing; a domain where trust can be well-founded, regulations are more mature and associated responsibilities clearer. We feel that IFC has great potential in the broader IoT context.

From the start, strong isolation between cloud tenants was seen to be of paramount importance, provided first by virtual machines (VM) and later by containers, which share the operating system (OS) kernel. Increasingly it is the case that applications also require facilities to effect isolation and protection of data managed by those applications. They also require flexible data sharing with other applications, often across the traditional cloud-isolation boundaries; for example, when government, consisting of different departments, provides services to its citizens through a common platform. These concerns relate to the management of data. Traditional access control is application and principal/role specific, applied at policy enforcement points, after which there is no subsequent control over where data flows;a crucial issue once data has left its owner‚Äôs control by cloud-hosted applications andwithin cloud-services. Information Flow Control (IFC), in addition, offers system-wide, end-to-end, flow control based on the properties of the data. We discuss the potential of cloud-deployed IFC for enforcing owners‚Äô data flow policy with regard to protection and sharing, aswell as safeguarding against malicious or buggy software. In addition, the audit log associated with IFC provides transparency and offers system-wide visibility over data flows. This helps those responsible to meet their data management obligations, providing evidence of compliance, and aids in the identification ofpolicy errors and misconfigurations.
