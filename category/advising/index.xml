      <title>The Thesis Proposal</title>
      <link>https://tfjmp.org/post/phd-proposal/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://tfjmp.org/post/phd-proposal/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The submission of your thesis proposal should normally occur in the second year
of the PhD program and before the end of the third year.
You can find more information about the process on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/policies/grad-handbook/phd-program/thesis-proposal&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;department website&lt;/a&gt;.
The process itself is clearly detailed, but the expected content of the thesis
proposal itself is underspecified.
This page describe my expectations for the students I supervise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;formatting-and-length&#34;&gt;Formatting and Length&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend to use the following &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tfjmp/ubcdiss&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;latex template&lt;/a&gt;.
Remember, that as per department rules, your thesis proposal &lt;strong&gt;must not&lt;/strong&gt; exceed
50 pages (excluding appendices).
The page limit is a maximum; it is not a target.
Successful Thesis Proposal documents can be shorter than the limit.
Writing within the page limit is important.
You should add all submissions and accepted publications since the start of your PhD
in the appendix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;content&#34;&gt;Content&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be 1 or 2 pages long and give a brief summary of the research you are
intending to pursue.
The early part of your summary, should contain your &lt;a href=&#34;https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~brecht/thesis-stmt-new.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;thesis statement&lt;/a&gt;
(more examples &lt;a href=&#34;https://depts.washington.edu/acelab/theses.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).
The thesis statement is central to the proposal and you should build the rest of
the document around it.
Your goal is to demonstrate than your proposed thesis is non-trivial, novel,
plausible and, importantly, useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can later subdivide your thesis statement into multiple research questions, but you
must ensure that they are clearly interconnected, and that they will lead
to a coherent thesis story.
You should also discuss why answering those questions is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;literature-review&#34;&gt;Literature review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal in this section is to demonstrate your understanding of the literature,
and to show the limitations of previous work.
This should be the basis to your claim of novelty,
and it should be clear how the proposed work fit within the existing literature.
The literature review should provide a &lt;strong&gt;critical&lt;/strong&gt; assessment of past work, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the identification of seminal work in the topic area;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the most closely related prior work;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a clear discussion of their strengths and limitations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part of the document could be used as a basis for a chapter in your final
thesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;progress-report&#34;&gt;Progress Report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have done preliminary research by the time you are submitting your
proposal and, ideally, have published some work based on your &lt;a href=&#34;https://tfjmp.org/post/rpe/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RPE&lt;/a&gt;.
The goal is to show the committee what you are capable of.
This helps the committee assess the plausibility of the thesis and of your proposed plan.
Published papers should be available in the appendix, and you do not need to
reproduce their content.
You should summarize them briefly in a self-contained way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;research-proposal&#34;&gt;Research Proposal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should build from your proposal summary and discuss how you are planning to
tackle your thesis and your research questions over the next 3+ years.
It may be useful to think of this in term of planned publications.
You could subdivide the planned research into multiple chunks.
Each chunk could be summarized into 3 or 4 paragraphs and corresponds to an
academic paper.
Those papers will form the basis for your thesis chapters.
At this stage you should plan for at least 2 or 3 full academic papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plan-and-timeline&#34;&gt;Plan and Timeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While your proposal should give the impression that failure of your research is
unlikely, in reality this possibility exists.
Indeed, it would not be research if failure was not possible.
Consequently, your plan must account for possible setbacks and failures, and
must discuss what you plan to do if something does not work out.
Your plan should also contain milestones as well as there completion and success
criteria.
A milestone, can be, for example, the submission or acceptance of a paper,
the release of a dataset, the completion of some software development task etc.
You may also discuss the evaluation strategies you will adopt to measure success
(e.g., your system successfully prevent vulnerability X while adding less than Y% overhead.)
This list of milestones should clearly and ultimately lead to the submission and defense of
your thesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, while you should provide completion dates for all milestones
those are not set in stone and some deviations are to be anticipated.
They are mostly there to demonstrate that you understand the timescale involved
in overcoming different research challenges (e.g., paper submissions must be
scheduled at a reasonable and plausible pace).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you need specialized hardware or specific software resources to
complete your research, this must be discussed in advance and clearly stated
in your thesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;proposal-submission&#34;&gt;Proposal Submission&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should plan a couple of months to work on your proposal. You should be ready
to send and discuss regular update with me during those months. Once we are in agreement that the
proposal is converging towards an acceptable output, you should contact the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/policies/grad-handbook/phd-program/phd-supervisory-committee&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;members of the committee&lt;/a&gt; and schedule a date for your defense.
You should send your proposal well in advance as to leave sufficient time for the
committee members to carefully review it.
It is also your responsibility to identify and make sure you fulfil all the department&amp;rsquo;s
administrative requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Research Proficiency Evaluation process</title>
      <link>https://tfjmp.org/post/rpe/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://tfjmp.org/post/rpe/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The official guidelines are provided on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/policies/grad-handbook/research-proficiency-evaluation-rpe/rpe-process&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;department website&lt;/a&gt;.
On this page, I give my take on the process and provide some pointers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-goal-of-the-rpe&#34;&gt;The goal of the RPE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the RPE is to 1) make sure you are ready for research; and
2) that the supervisory relationship is working. It is best to identify problems
early, and the goal is not to fail you but to ensure you are ready to succeed.
In my opinion, the RPE should be a well-defined, reasonably scoped, and
self-contained project. The RPE is not your Ph.D., you should think of it as
starting to work on your first paper (at UBC) and it should be scoped
consequently. You may have a grand ambition for your Ph.D.,
but you need to wrap the RPE project in only a few months.
Consequently, you need to identify a set of clear and meaningful objectives where
you can make significant progress within the available time frame.
There is an expectation that your RPE will lead to a publication, but this is
not expected to happen before your defense. However, you need to show you are
working in that direction (e.g., by showing preliminary results and a prototype).
Finally, The self-contained aspect is important if you are working as part
of a larger project, the RPE must be based on your work and your contribution
must be clearly identifiable.
My role is to work with you, support you, and make sure things go smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deliverable&#34;&gt;Deliverable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For written reports, I suggest using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;USENIX template&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RPE proposal&lt;/strong&gt;: expected length is around two pages. This should focus on the problem
definition. However, from experience, most students submit slightly longer proposals (5-6 pages)
including an expanded related work section and a description of their proposed solution.
This is not necessary, but you should feel free to include this if you want feedback on those aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RPE report&lt;/strong&gt;: expected length is around twelve pages. Your report should be
written and organized like a conference paper. You may consider including a long
discussion section containing: 1) limitations of your current prototype/proof of concept; 2) work
you are planning to do over the next few months to turn your RPE work into a publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RPE presentation&lt;/strong&gt;: expected length is around twenty minutes. You should present
your work as you would at a conference. You should cover the following topics: 1) context and problem;
2) solution; 3) evaluation; and 4) future work. You should
rehearse your presentation (you can ask me and your peers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should not hesitate to discuss with other students in the lab, and ask for examples
of their submissions. Further, I am expecting to see several drafts of your
written work/presentation. I will normally ask for it, but you should feel free
to send it to me as soon as you want feedback. Unlike work you do for a joint paper submission, I will avoid rewriting your text. However, I am more than happy to (and will) comment.
I also encourage you to share drafts with some of your peers working on
different projects (forming a writing group with other students taking their RPE at the same time can be a very positive experience). Sharing your work with peers help you gauge how accessible your writings are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deadlines&#34;&gt;Deadlines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume a student starting in September (if you start in January, tweak the timeline accordingly).
Here is my vision of how you should approach the RPE process.
Remember, as your advisor/supervisor it is my job to get you through this process
successfully. This means you should talk to me and seek help and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September&lt;/strong&gt;, you hopefully have an idea of why you came to UBC and what you want to work on.
You should spend your first few months getting familiar with the relevant literature,
writing an annotated bibliography/notes about your reading, and start designing and implementing prototypes to test your ideas.
In addition, you may also decide to join an existing project, get up to speed with the project, and participate actively.
During our 1-1 meeting I would expect to discuss your growing understanding of
the field, and your ideas. Part of my job is to challenge your ideas
and force you to think critically about the problems you propose to investigate and potential solutions.
Defining research problems is one of the most important skills to acquire early on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December&lt;/strong&gt;, you should start crystalizing the research problem you want to
tackle during your RPE. Identify, the relevant literature and what is the state
of the art in that space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January&lt;/strong&gt;, this is the time to start working on the proposal. In addition to formalizing and writing down your proposal, you should consider doing some preliminary technical experimentation. My advice is to take only a single course during this term. You want to ensure you have enough
time dedicated to research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March&lt;/strong&gt;, we select together your RPE committee. This is relatively simple,
we need to identify two faculties such that their interests overlap with your RPE project
and who have time to seat on your committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April&lt;/strong&gt;, you submit your proposal and get feedback from the committee. You should
expect again your ideas to be challenged in a supportive way. The goal is to help
you formulate a clear problem. You should digest the feedback and make corrections
accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May&lt;/strong&gt;, you can now start working on your project in earnest. At this point,
you should be done with courses and you should be able to focus on your research
full-time. You are strongly encouraged to do so. I am expecting to get messages
from students several times a week at this point. Don&amp;rsquo;t be shy, if you need to
discuss your struggles and/or design decisions do so! You may also want to chat
with other students in the lab, especially those working on related topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August&lt;/strong&gt;, you have hopefully been taking notes on your implementation, design,
and the literature you have read. It is time to write your RPE report. Remember,
the goal is to show you are able to perform research at a level expected from a
Ph.D. student. You may not have finished everything you wanted to do, but you need
to show at least an early prototype and some early evaluation results. You should also
demonstrate that you understand how to move from what you have to a publication
(i.e., clearly articulate the work you are planning to do over the next few months).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September&lt;/strong&gt;, it is time to submit the report and organize the defense. Do not
be overly concerned with the defense. You will be told before the presentation is scheduled if there are
any concerns about the quality of the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;failing-the-rpe&#34;&gt;Failing the RPE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, a student failing during the public defense should be avoided and
in most circumstances would be the supervisor&amp;rsquo;s responsibility.
There are multiple deadlines within the RPE that are opportunities to give
feedback and to have a difficult conversation if things are not going as they
should.
Your proposal and report are read by your supervisor and the committee members, you
should be told if there are concerns about their standard.
If that is the case, you should work with your supervisor on a positive outcome.
This outcome will depend on why things are not working well and can include
solutions such as an extension, looking for a new supervisor, or continuing in
the MSc program if you are a Ph.D. track student.
I also strongly encourage you to talk with other faculties or your peers in such
circumstances and to seek support to decide on your next steps.
In short, the process is designed to avoid failure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Working with me</title>
      <link>https://tfjmp.org/post/working-with-me/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://tfjmp.org/post/working-with-me/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This page describes how my lab is typically run.
I aim to tailor individual experience to fit individual student&amp;rsquo;s needs, but this serves as the general starting point of our relationships.
On &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;, I briefly describe what students can expect from me and what I expect from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-contact-me&#34;&gt;How to contact me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best time to discuss research is during our project or 1-on-1 meetings.
Outside of those, the best way to contact me is through instant messaging (using Systopia&amp;rsquo;s discord server is probably the best way to get hold of me).
Instant messaging is ideal for informal exchanges and discussing day-to-day research progress.
I am expecting that students would be in touch a few times during the week, and I may probe about your progress.
In case of more formal interactions, for example, to complete some administrative task, e-mails at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:tfjmp@cs.ubc.ca&#34;&gt;tfjmp@cs.ubc.ca&lt;/a&gt; are the best choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;interactions-outside-of-working-hours&#34;&gt;Interactions outside of working hours&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academics are notorious for working at asocial hours.
I may send a message at a random time during the week, for example, as I was reading a paper that I think is interesting and relevant to your research.
However, I do not expect an immediate response.
Similarly, you should not expect an immediate response to a message sent at 3 am.
However, I endeavor to respond within one working day whenever possible and would expect the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;meetings&#34;&gt;Meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am expecting to meet my advisees regularly (at least once a week).
I track my meetings with google calendar.
If a meeting is not on my calendar I am unlikely to show up.
I expect students to come to the meeting or to let me know in advance if they cannot.
Students are responsible for running the meetings and should be proactive.
This means preparing a report on their progress and important points to discuss.
Students should send a written update the day before with clear indications of any document I should read before the meeting (e.g., important related work, paper/report draft, code etc.).
I get extremely frustrated if I am expected to have a meaningful interaction on a 15 pages paper I haven&amp;rsquo;t read.
Debugging code, system setups, and the like is best done asynchronously through instant messaging and should generally not be the topic of our meetings.
This means that if you get stuck on a technical issue, you should contact me ASAP so I can have a look and hopefully help.
Finally, I have to divide time between multiple students, projects, and other responsibilities.
This means that it is vital for your own progress that you take the lead in moving your project forwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancel meeting when you have nothing to discuss.&lt;/strong&gt;
It is fine to drop me a message to tell me you haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to make meaningful progress and would like to cancel a meeting.
Obviously, I would not expect multiple meetings to be canceled in a row (unless you are facing hardship in such case do let me know so I can ensure you get support).
I would expect heads up on canceled meetings to come sufficiently early as to be respectful of the time of all people involved in those meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancel meeting if something urgent happens.&lt;/strong&gt;
We all get sick and have family issues or personal matters to deal with.
This means that at some point meetings may need to be canceled and this is fine.
You should just make sure to let everyone involved know as soon as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;managing-software-artifacts&#34;&gt;Managing Software Artifacts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most research at UBC is enabled through public funds.
This means that we have a duty to be transparent about the outcome of our work and to share it with the wider community.
In practice, this means that you should properly manage your software artifacts.
This includes practices such as documenting, using version control, using proper licenses etc.
The default assumption is that your code and any other artifacts will be made publicly available after the corresponding paper is published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important to produce software that can run.
Consequently, I tend to insist on the use of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;continuous integration tools and practices&lt;/a&gt; and I would expect us to set this up together in the early stage of a project.
I am also a big fan of disposable and reproducible development environments and I strongly encourage you to look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vagrantup.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;how to use Vagrant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;interpersonal-communication-and-cultural-expectations&#34;&gt;Interpersonal Communication and Cultural Expectations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBC is an English-speaking and liberal environment with its own cultural expectations.
However, this may sometimes be at odds with what you have been experiencing while growing up.
Other mismatches of expectations may arise from class, religion, sexual orientation, and many other dimensions that compose your identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YMyofREc5Jk&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These differences in expectations and perceptions can create tensions.
This means that we all need to be mindful of each other.
Living in a multicultural society requires understanding and kindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;paper-writing&#34;&gt;Paper Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should aim to submit the best paper we can.
This means that we may miss a deadline if I feel that the paper is not ready.
I &lt;strong&gt;do not&lt;/strong&gt; write papers at the last minute.
I expect a full draft of a submission with full evaluation to be ready one or two weeks before the deadline and the final week to be dedicated to polish and styling.
Consequently, I aim to specify the target conference long in advance and to revise our target if it becomes clear that we won&amp;rsquo;t have a quality submission ready by the deadline.
However, note that more and more top-tier conferences have multiple deadlines during the year.
This means, in practice, that we can submit a much stronger paper a few months later.
You are &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; to submit a paper without the explicit consent of all authors.
Authors are expected to be available around paper deadlines and you should be mindful of those when making other commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing a paper requires much more effort than most junior graduate students expect.
We will go through multiple iterations with the first draft being significantly different from the final submitted version.
You are expected to seek and take feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors ordering is important and must be discussed between the authors.
The first author is generally the student who has done most of the work, followed by other students that assisted.
Follow faculty members with the senior authors generally being the advisor of the first author.
Please, discuss if/when you have a concern about the ordering of authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All papers must be written in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt;.
You are expected to learn to use LaTeX and the associated toolset.
I will create a private GitHub repository with the template for the paper.
We will normally &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; use overleaf or similar tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you are the first author you have some additional responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are in charge of driving the paper forwards and organizing meetings;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are expected to take a significant share of the writing;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must ensure that the paper follows submission guidelines (page limits, formatting, anonymity, etc.);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must submit the paper before the deadline and ensure that all authors are happy with the submission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect to be regularly involved in the writing process and I will provide regular feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vtIzMaLkCaM&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;publication-expectations&#34;&gt;Publication Expectations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSc students should aim to complete at least one major conference paper before they graduate.
PhD students should target at least three major conference papers before they graduate.
Those are not official guidelines, but serve as an indication of what a student doing &amp;ldquo;well&amp;rdquo; looks like.
Publications are in a sense more important than the degree you will obtain and must be one of the main focus of your time at UBC.
For example, obtaining a PhD will be the minimum requirement if you apply for an academic position, the work you have published will be the most important criteria when assessing your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lab-life--service&#34;&gt;Lab Life &amp;amp; Service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you join my team you will be part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.ubc.ca/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Department of Computer Science at UBC&lt;/a&gt; and in particular of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Systopia Lab&lt;/a&gt;.
As such, there are some expectations where participation in lab life is concerned.
You are expected to come to the lab regularly and interact with your colleagues (collaborations are very important and the interactions between graduate students are an integral part of a successful graduate experience).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are also expected to participate in the life of the lab, attend reading group sessions, and presentations.
There is also a number of positions to be filled every year, including organizing social events, maintaining our website, managing our social media presence, and more.
Those activities are led by students, and it is expected that, as you become familiar with the lab, you will start participating actively.
You may also wish to participate in department-level or university-level service.
Finally, you may want to get involved with the research community by participating in different activities such as artifacts evaluation committee, shadow program committee, and program committee.
This is also encouraged and I am happy to provide support if needed and as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should note that those activities are important and can help with your career progression.
Multiple fellowships explicitly mention those in selection criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weight will also be attached to the student’s academic excellence and to her or his involvement in helping others (e.g. tutoring, service on a student council, organizing student activities, and volunteer work outside the university).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/CGSD-BESCD_eng.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Canada Graduate Scholarships – Doctoral program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional, academic and extracurricular activities as well as collaborations with supervisors, colleagues, peers, students and members of the community, such as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;teaching, mentoring, supervising and/or coaching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;managing projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;participating in science and/or research promotion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;participating in community outreach, volunteer work and/or civic engagement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chairing committees and/or organizing conferences and meetings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;participating in departmental or institutional organizations, associations, societies and/or clubs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are obviously some circumstances that may prevent you from participating.
You may also need to be away from the lab for some time (e.g., family or health issues).
This is perfectly fine but this should be discussed in advance to ensure you have proper support (there is a number of initiative within the university to support students going through hardships).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;equipment&#34;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you require equipment to pursue research, I am happy to purchase it for you.
However, this equipment will be purchased through grant money.
This means that the equipment is the property of UBC and that you should take care of it and use it with this in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;raship-and-taship&#34;&gt;RAship and TAship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you have secured a fellowship (you are strongly encouraged to look for those as it will strenghten your CV significantly), you are likely to be funded through RAship or TAship.
Most of you will be familiar with Teaching Assistant duties.
You will receive monetary compensation and it is therefore expected that you behave professionally and perform your duties to the best of your ability.
Fulfilling expectations of those roles take precedence over your coursework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New students joining the group will be expected to work as a teaching assistant during their first year unless agreed otherwise.
We will most likely discuss RAship opportunities towards the end of your first year.
Those opportunities are dependent on funding availability, and your academic and research progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research Assistantships are generally funded through specific grants.
The funder allocates money for us to work on a specific research topic.
This means two things: 1) there is some expectation for us to produce results (this includes papers and software artifacts); and 2) that we work within the context of the funding agreement.
This means that by taking a RAship you must work on the agreed-upon topic.
It is my job to make sure the grant gives you a reasonable degree of freedom but if we agreed to do research on how to make the best pizza, we may not be able to work on how to make the best paella.
If you wish to change your research topic, you must discuss this in advance and as early as possible.
Similarly, if there is no sufficient progress as to fulfil our engagement with the funder, we may discuss alternative route to fund your research.
Note, that I may not be able to provide the same amount financial support outside of our original agreed uppon topic.
If you make extra-work commitments (side-projects, consulting, extra-teaching, etc.), I must be made aware.
Be aware that some grants/funding are tied to IP agreements and it may affect work you do on closely related topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;internships&#34;&gt;Internships&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internships are a great opportunity to gain new skills, build your network and expand your horizon.
I strongly encourage graduate students, especially, PhD students to seek such a position during the course of their degree.
You should try to identify an internship that &lt;em&gt;helps&lt;/em&gt; with your research and career goal (acquiring complementary skills, researching a related topic etc.).
It is possible to get an internship at any point during you degree, however, internships done a few years in your degree tend to be more valuable (you are productive much faster, you can more effectively leverage the network you will build etc.), further the first summer(s) are likely to be the time when you start your research in earnest.
You should start to think about internship towards the end of the &lt;em&gt;Winter 1 term&lt;/em&gt; of the year you are planning to do your summer internship.
Talk to faculties and students in Systopia, and more importantly talk with me!
You should also be mindful of any engagement you have (Are you part of a team that is working for a submission during the summer? Have you signed to TA some summer course? Are you expected to produce some report as part of your degree? Is it ok given your source of funding?).
Finally, remember that immigration issues may affect your eligibility for internships.
This is a complex matter and faculties are generally ill-equipped to help.
The best source of advice on the matter at UBC is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/international-student-advising&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;International Student Advising&lt;/a&gt; service.
You should contact them as you start planning to apply for internships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;phd-timeline&#34;&gt;Ph.D. Timeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the official timeline on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/policies/grad-handbook/phd-program/phd-program-timeline&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;department website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Year 1 - Prepare and pass the &lt;a href=&#34;https://tfjmp.org/post/rpe/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Research Proficiency Evaluation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Year 2/3 - PhD Proposal and course requirement completion, move to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.grad.ubc.ca/current-students/managing-your-program/advancement-candidacy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;candidacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/phd-computer-science&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; 3.33 years &amp;amp; &amp;lt; 9 years ; on average 5.77 years&lt;/a&gt;) submit and defend your PhD thesis!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
